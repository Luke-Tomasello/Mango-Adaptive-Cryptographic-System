# Contributing to Mango — Adaptive Cryptographic Workbench

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Mango! This project welcomes contributions that improve performance, correctness, documentation, and cryptographic clarity.

## 🛠 Contribution Guidelines

### 1. Fork the Repository
Please fork the Mango repo and create a feature branch in your fork.

```
git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature
```

### 2. Make Focused Changes
Keep pull requests focused and atomic. Avoid unrelated changes in a single PR. If possible, accompany changes with:
- A brief description of the reason behind them
- Before/after impact (especially for transforms or metric behavior)

---

## 🔁 Pull Request Process

1. We use **pull requests from forks only** — direct pushes to the main repo are disabled.
2. All pull requests are subject to **manual review**.
3. **We use squash merging** to maintain a clean, linear commit history.
4. Ensure your PR can be **cleanly squashed**:
   - Keep commits logically grouped
   - Rebase if necessary to resolve conflicts

---

## 🧪 Testing & Review

- All submitted changes must pass **regression testing** via the Mango Workbench.
- If your changes introduce new transforms or sequences, please include:
  - A short description of the transform’s behavior
  - Recommended test data (Natural, Random, Sequence, Combined)

---

## ✅ Coding Style

- Use consistent naming conventions
- Follow existing formatting patterns
- Comment non-obvious logic (especially cryptographic algorithms)

## ❤️ Thank You

We appreciate your contributions — Mango exists because of collaboration, experimentation, and shared curiosity.
