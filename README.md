# Mango — Adaptive Cryptographic Workbench

> ⚡ Up to 185× faster than AES.  
> ✅ Passes all 9/9 cryptographic metrics.  
> 🔄 Fully reversible. Tuned for structured, random, and real-world data.

## What is Adaptive Cryptography?

Traditional ciphers apply a fixed sequence of operations to all input data, regardless of its structure. Mango introduces a new approach: **adaptive cryptography** — the idea that an encryption system should respond to the characteristics of the input itself.

Instead of treating all data equally, Mango **profiles the input**, determines its structure (e.g., random, natural, sequential), and dynamically selects an optimized transformation sequence designed to maximize entropy, dispersion, and cryptographic strength.

## How Mango Differs from Traditional Ciphers

Mango is not a drop-in AES clone — it is a full cryptographic workbench and cipher engine designed for adaptability and analysis. Key differences include:

- 🔀 **Input-Adaptive Sequences**  
  Each data type triggers a tailored transform path to maximize disruption of predictability.

- 🔁 **Atomic Transform Architecture**  
  Over 30 low-level transforms (e.g., bit shufflers, feedback mixers, pattern equalizers) can be composed into sequences.

- 📊 **Metric-Based Scoring**  
  Mango evaluates sequences against entropy, avalanche, bit variance, and other cryptographic metrics.

- ⚙️ **Reversible and Deterministic**  
  Every sequence is reversible, every output decryptable — no randomness is hidden from the user.

## Design Goals

Mango delivers **AES-class cryptographic strength** with **significantly faster execution**.  
Its adaptive engine analyzes input data in real time, **tailoring its encryption path** to maintain high entropy, diffusion, and unpredictability — even **outperforming AES** on structured or semi-structured data where static ciphers fall short.

|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| High throughput          | ✅ Significantly faster than AES (CLR)     |
| Cryptographic strength   | ✅ Passes avalanche, entropy, and periodicity tests |
| Tunability               | ✅ Transform rounds and sequence lengths tunable |

## Quick Start

Mango supports two primary usage modes:

### 🧩 Run the Interactive Cryptographic Workbench

The Mango Workbench (`Mango.exe`) allows you to interactively assemble, test, and analyze cryptographic sequences composed of ~40 atomic transforms.  
You can build pipelines of arbitrary complexity, execute them, and view detailed metrics for strength, reversibility, and speed.

```
cd Workbench/bin
Mango.exe
```

From within the Workbench, you can:

Build and run custom transform sequences

Evaluate cryptographic strength using entropy, avalanche, and other metrics

Run comparative analysis against AES

Load curated sequences and benchmark results from prior Munge runs

### 🔧 Run a Minimal Standalone Example

If you're a developer or researcher interested in stepping through Mango's adaptive cryptographic engine in a minimal setting:

**Adaptive Cryptography (Single Block Mode)**

```
cd MangoAC/bin
MangoAC.exe
```

This example profiles a sample input, selects the best transform sequence for it, and performs a full encryption → decryption → verification cycle.

**Adaptive Cryptography in Block Mode**

```
cd MangoBM/bin
MangoBM.exe
```

This example demonstrates block-based encryption using Mango. It encrypts and decrypts multiple blocks of structured data, using a cached transform header in the first block.
Ideal for exploring how Mango might integrate into streaming or block-wise systems.
